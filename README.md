# Good Podcasts

I recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/francesc/status/915782925752270848)
asking for advice on what podcasts I should be listening to.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What&#39;s your favorite <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/podcast?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#podcast</a>?<br>Technical or not, something I can learn from</p>&mdash; Francesc (@francesc) <a href="https://twitter.com/francesc/status/915782925752270848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2017</a></blockquote>
